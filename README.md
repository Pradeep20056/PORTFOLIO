I have developed a basic yet effective personal portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to showcase my skills, projects, and contact details in a clean and responsive layout. The primary goal of this project was to establish an online presence as a web developer and demonstrate my frontend development capabilities. I used HTML for structuring the content, CSS for styling and layout customization, and JavaScript for adding interactivity and dynamic behavior. The website features a responsive design, ensuring smooth and adaptive viewing across different devices like desktops, tablets, and smartphones. Key sections included in the portfolio are a homepage, about me, projects, and a contact form. I incorporated smooth scroll effects, hover animations, and button transitions to enhance the user experience. For icons and visuals, I utilized Font Awesome and optimized images to maintain fast loading times. The project follows a clean and organized folder structure, separating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for better maintainability. One of the highlights of the portfolio is the interactive project gallery, which allows users to view details of each project by hovering or clicking. The contact form is functional with simple front-end validation. This portfolio not only serves as a personal branding tool but also reflects my growing interest and knowledge in web development.
